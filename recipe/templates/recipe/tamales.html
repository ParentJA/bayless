      ave frequently wondered what those tamales must have tasted like four and a half centuries ago. Were they made of coarse-ground corn and wrapped like fat cigars in cornhusks, as many are today? Or was the dough smooth (perhaps even stirred over the fire before the tamales were formed); could the wrappers have been banana leaves? Might the tightly tied packages have been cooked in simmering liquid, as I’ve seen in Chiapas, rather than steamed above it? Would they have tasted more like a pudding, as do the chokecherry ones they sometimes sell in the Tolucan market? And without the lard brought by the Spaniards, wouldn’t the pre-Columbian corn loaves have been heavy and dense?

      yield of the cook’s craft, sadly, is a perishable one, which means that the answers to many of my questions will remain incomplete at best. The old cookbooks fail to supply much of the bygone detail that was commonly shared knowledge for writer and reader. And the anthropological records only tantalize us with vague references to different colors, shapes and flavors, before they move on to describe the special varieties of tamales that were gifts to the gods during the twelfth month of the Aztecs’ eighteen-month year. That was an ancient holiday, as it happened, that coincided rather nicely with the conquerors’ All Saints’ Day (Day of the Dead, as they call it in Mexico), resulting in the two becoming a thoroughly mestizo fiesta—celebrated in honor of all who’ve gone to the other world, celebrated with an eye to the earthly pleasures of drink and food…tamales included.

      ll today, when people eat tamales in Mexico (except perhaps in some big cities), there is at least a hint of fiesta in the air. When family and friends get together to make them, the event is a tamal-making-party-before-the-party, a time to take full advantage of the high-spirited company while everyone shares in the special preparations.

      those who don’t make their own, tamales are often on sale from fragrant steamers along the routes of Sunday-evening strolls (paseos) in parks or main squares. In towns where tamales are a specialty, the market stalls and coffee shops serve them, hot in their cornhusk or banana-leaf wrappers, frequently with earthenware mugs full of the traditional, warm, masa-thickened atole, in variations from fruit to nut, chocolate to plain white.

      ay this pairing of tamales with atole has come to seem old-fashioned, so some folks drink soda pop or coffee or hot chocolate with the steamed corn cakes. But during the days when there was only one liquid accompaniment, Sra. Josefina Velázquez de León wrote her classic cookbook Tamales y atoles, filled with recipes for deliciously flavored porridges and the different tamales that are the pride of each region.

      majority of the tamales—no matter what their filling, flavoring or wrapping—start with a dough of masa para tamales (“corn dough for tamales”) or harina para tamales (“cornmeal for tamales”) made from dried field corn that has been boiled briefly with slaked lime, hulled and coarsely ground: If dried first, it makes meal; if ground wet, the result is a coarse-textured dough.

      d, flavorful, fresh lard is the second ingredient, and it is pliable enough to trap air when beaten, causing the dough to expand as the tamales steam and making each bite tender and delicious. The dough is mixed up with a light-flavored broth; and, to help ensure that the tamales puff up light and tender, baking powder is stirred in. Baking powder, of course, is of recent manufacture, the long-used leavening (and one still used by some traditional cooks) being the agua de tequesquite (a mixture of saltpeter and water in which skins of tomatillos have been boiled).

      ing a tamal party: Because tamales are so special and can be made ahead, they are ideal for large informal parties—whether you prepare one variety or several. To prepare larger quantities of any of the tamales, simply multiply out the recipe, make the dough in a large heavy-duty mixer (using the paddle, not the whisk) and gather together lots of friends to help form the tamales; use a large kettle or two for steaming. Small tamales can be put out in their wrappers as appetizers, accompanied by fresh vegetables and dip, a Jícama Salad, Cactus-Paddle Salad and/or Chunky Guacamole. Also, tamales are substantial enough to be a light buffet main course, served with Frijoles Refritos or Charro Beans, a Mixed Vegetable Salad, Flan, and beer or one of the coolers; for the sake of tradition, I’d make a warm Chocolate Atole.

      pling my penchant for tamales with their endless variety, it would be easy to fill a volume with regional specialties. I have chosen, instead, not to test any reader’s patience, including in this list only the most distinctive, easy-to-find ones. Culiacán, Sinaloa: large tamales with meat and vegetables, plus everyday smaller ones made of sweetened brown beans, pineapple and fresh corn, among others. Veracruz: fresh corn tamales with pork and the anise-flavored herb hoja santa, plus banana leaf—wrapped tamales made from smooth masa, chicken and the same herb. Monterrey: small, cigar-size tamales of smooth or coarse dough flavored with red chiles and filled with shredded meat. Oaxaca: large, banana leaf—wrapped tamales laced with the special Oaxacan black mole, plus husk-wrapped ones filled with the local green or yellow moles, black beans or the herb called chepil. Yucatán: very large pit- or oven-baked tamales called pibipollos, made of smooth-ground masa flavored with achiote and filled with chicken and/or pork; also, chanchames (husk-wrapped tamales with achiote-flavored filling), vaporcitos (a thin layer of masa patted on banana leaf, folded over a filling, then steamed), tamales colados (a very light, precooked dough of strained masa and broth, with a filling of chicken, tomato and achiote), among others. San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas: tamales untados are banana leaf—wrapped tamales filled with pork and a sweet, light mole (sold at houses that put out a red lantern on Saturday night); tamales de mumu are wrapped in cornhusks with a preliminary wrapper of mumu leaf (related to the hoja santa), among many others. Michoacán: the smooth, dense (but tender) unfilled rhomboid shapes called corundas, wrapped in the leaves of the corn plant; also, fresh corn tamales called uchepos. Northwestern Mexico, especially Pánuco, Veracruz: huge three-or four-foot tamales called zacahuiles, made from very coarsely ground corn flavored with red chile, filled with pork, wrapped in banana leaves and baked in a huge, wood-heated oven in special restaurants on weekends. Central and West Central Mexico: See the notes.
