    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    I’ve seen them in the frenetic Friday Toluca market every time I’ve been there: pieces of catfish, carp or little, minnowlike charales, bathed with a sharp red-chile sauce, packed into several layers of husk, and turned on a griddle until charred. The picante flavors of the fish and the smoky overtones from the blackened husks are delicious.For the recipe that follows, I’ve taken this humble fish snack (found predominantly in Central Mexico and Michoacán) and turned it into a dish to serve at the table. It is quite an attractive presentation and a delicious blend of uncommon flavors. I call for the traditional taco garnishes—fresh coriander (cilantro) and onion—because I serve the dish with hot corn tortillas and encourage each person to make tacos with the tasty strips of fish. Accompany it with Pueblan Rice and set out a big Mixed Vegetable Salad to start, if you want. Pecan Pie with Raw Sugar is good for dessert; beer, Mexican Sangria or Sparkling Limeade are my choices for beverage.

    Instructions

   <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
     <li>
      Soaking the husks and marinating the fish. Put the cornhusks to soak in boiling water as directed. Cut the fish into 3-inch sticks that are ½ inch wide. Place in a noncorrosive bowl, measure in 6 tablespoons of the adobo paste and mix gently but thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
     </li>
     <li>
      The fish-filled cornhusk packages. Choose the 18 largest cornhusks: They should be 6 inches across on their widest end; if any fall short, two may be laid together, overlapping at least 2 inches. From the extra cornhusks, tear off twenty-four ¼-inch-wide strips and tie them together in pairs, making 12 long ones. Divide the fish into 6 equal portions.
     </li>
     <li>
      form the packages, spread 1 teaspoon of adobo paste over a 2 × 3-inch area on the wide end of a husk. Lay half of one portion of fish in a single layer over the adobo-covered part of the husk. Lightly sprinkle with salt and top with the remaining half-portion of fish. Lightly salt again, then spread with a teaspoon of adobo paste. Bring the uncovered sides of the husk up around the fish, tucking one under the other. Fold the unfilled, narrow end of the husk up over the filled portion, then flip the package over onto the wide end of another husk (open-end toward the center). Wrap the long sides of the new husk up around the package, overlapping them. Fold the narrow, unfilled portion of the husk up over the filled part, then flip the package over onto the wide end of yet another husk and wrap the package again. Lay the finished package flap-side down and tie it twice around its width with 2 of the cornhusk strips. Form the rest of the fish-filled packages in the same manner.

      Cooking the packages. About 20 minutes before serving, heat a large griddle over medium-high or turn on your broiler and position the rack 4 inches below the heat.
     </li>
     <li>
      griddle cooking: Lay the packages on the griddle. Cook 6 or 7 minutes on each side, plus an additional minute on each long edge.
     </li>
     <li>
      broiler cooking: Lay the packages on a baking sheet and slide them under the broiler. Flip after about 7 minutes (the cornhusks should have blackened), then cook 5 or 6 minutes longer.
     </li>
     <li>
      n one package and test for doneness (being careful to contain the juices).
     </li>
     <li>
      Presenting the dish. Remove the strings from each package, then carefully pull away the two outer layers of husk, being careful not to lose any of the juices. Set each package on a warm plate, open up the remaining husk and gently push the fish into the center. Mix together the chopped onion and fresh coriander; sprinkle 2 tablespoons over each portion. Top each one with a sprig of coriander and lay a couple of lime wedges to the side. Serve immediately.
