    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    It’s the slight chewiness of the tortillas I think you’ll enjoy, run through as they are with the flavor of broth, tomatoes, tomatillos and chiles. And then there’s the drizzling of thick, glassy cream. Chilaquiles are a favorite choice in coffee shops from the U.S. border to Guatemala—simmered with a locally popular sauce, plus an endless variety of chunky vegetables, meat, eggs and sausage. The Guadalajara market cooks keep cazuelas of them on hand during morning hours; after a long simmering, they take on the texture of a coarse polenta. And the standard Mexico City version calls for a spicy tomatillo sauce and a whole sprig of epazote in every portion—apt ingredients for a dish whose name means “chiles and herbs” in Nahuatl.This simple restaurant version of chilaquiles, which I learned in the capital, plays an unchanging role in morning food. It also makes a nice supper when paired with a salad and/or Pan-Fried Chile-Marinated Pork; it can even replace enchiladas in Steak a la Tampiqueña.

      The tortillas. Cut the tortillas into eighths. If they are moist, dry them out for a few minutes in a 350° oven, until quite leathery.
     </li>
     <li>
      r the oil into a medium-size skillet set over medium-high heat. When hot enough to make the edge of a tortilla sizzle, add half the tortilla pieces. Turn them frequently until they are lightly browned and nearly crisp, then remove and drain on paper towels. Fry and drain the remaining tortilla pieces in the same fashion. Reduce the heat to medium-low and discard any oil that remains.
     </li>
     <li>
      Simmering the chilaquiles. Return the tortilla pieces to the skillet and add the sauce, broth, optional chicken and optional epazote. Stir well to coat the tortillas, cover the skillet and simmer until the tortillas are soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
