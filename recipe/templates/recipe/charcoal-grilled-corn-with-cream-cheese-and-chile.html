    Description

   <div class="description">
    Out on a walk in practically any Mexican town, who can pass up the always-present fresh ears of chewy field corn, turning and crisping over the coals? Who isn’t attracted to the smoky-smelling, pit-roasted ears (pibinales) when they’re poured from gunnysacks in Yucatán? And who doesn’t like the fried corn kernels with epazote and chiles in Toluca (esquites), or the ones served from big boiling cazuelas in the capital’s Alameda Park, or the ones topped with cream, powdered chile and cheese in the northeastern states?Our sweet corn isn’t the same to me, boiled and buttered and served as a summertime vegetable. It lacks a little backbone. So when I’m having it, I usually give it the taste of an open fire, a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of hot powdered chile…or the lavish spread of butter, cream and cheese of this recipe. Serve it anytime you’re grilling, and you’ll please practically everyone.

      Preliminaries. About an hour before serving, place the ears of corn in a deep bowl, cover with cold water and weight with a plate to keep them submerged. Light your charcoal fire and let it burn until the bed of coals is medium-hot; adjust the grill 4 inches above the fire.

      Grilling the corn. Lay the corn on the grill and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, turning frequently, until the outer leaves are blackened. Remove, let cool several minutes, then remove the husks and silk. About 10 minutes before serving, brush the corn with melted butter, return to the grill and turn frequently until nicely browned. Serve right away, passing the cream, cheese and powdered chile for your guests to use to their own liking.
