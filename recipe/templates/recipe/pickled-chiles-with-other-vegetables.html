    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    When you taste a pickled chile from the glass barrels in Querétaro, Aguascalientes or San Luis Potosí, or from the beautiful bottled mixtures in Toluca or San Cristóbal de las Cases, Chiapas, the flavor seems so much more lively than the canned pickled jalapeños that fill our grocery-store shelves. No doubt it’s because the Mexican ones are often made with homemade fruit vinegar and the chiles include a wide variety of sizes and colors.For the Central Mexican recipe outlined here, the onions and carrots are first fried, then simmered with the chiles in the mild brine. The same method can be used for making pickled vegetables, as described in the variation recipe; the result is attractive and delicious for a picnic or buffet table.

     <li>
      Frying the vegetables. In a medium-size skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium, add the whole garlic cloves and fry, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes, until they are lightly browned; remove and set aside. Add the carrot, chiles and onion, and fry, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
     </li>
     <li>
      Simmering the chiles. Add ½ cup water, the browned garlic, vinegar, bay leaves, herbs, pepper and salt. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until the carrot is barely tender and the chiles are olive-green. Remove from the fire, pour into a noncorrosive container, cool and season with additional salt, if necessary. Cover and refrigerate for a day before using.
