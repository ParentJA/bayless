      whimsical names of the “little whims” (as antojito literally translates) continue to multiply: The cooks and eaters never stop thinking up picturesque and unflattering christenings for the ways they pinch and push, fry, bake and steam their corn dough. A favorite game of Mexican writers is to list off those names, line after line after line, never bothering to let you know that they’re all variations on a handful of styles.

      er exploring the major approaches to antojitos in the preceding sections, we’re now face to face with the masa boats (sopes and garnachas, just two of their many names), the delicious fat tortillas (gorditas) that puff like pita bread to hold their fillings, the infamous hoagielike sandwiches called tortas and the widely popular, quick-simmered tortilla casserole (chilaquiles) that makes an everyday lunch or supper in our house. They’re as adaptable as all the other antojitos; they’re appetizers, snacks, light meals and, in the case of chilaquiles, even side dishes.

      collection of antojitos would be representative if it didn’t at least nod in the direction of tostadas. I have eaten crisp-tender little 4-inch tostadas with lime-cured meat in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas; thick 6-inch tostadas of pickled pigs’ feet and pork rind in the West-Central states; the stuffed panuchos of Yucatán; and the huge Oaxacan toasted—not fried—clayudas that serve as a dinner plate for a rich array of unusual toppings. But never, I must admit, did I come across anything in Mexico like the California version of tostadas: the crisp flour-tortilla baskets filled with enough lettuce salad to feed several indulgent people. No, in Mexico, tostadas are simply crispy food conveyors made of corn tortillas—the consumable little plates used by many street vendors. In the coffee shops, they may be piled a little higher to serve as a light meal rather than a light snack; or in a refined traditional restaurant, they may be delicately topped with a little something spicy, to go with drinks.

      t follows in this chapter, then, pretty well fills out the traditional Mexican antojito offerings.
