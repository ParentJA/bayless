    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    Brothy beans are undeniably humble when set next to a dollop of rich, well-fried frijoles refritos. The two share the same beginnings, though, and fried or not, beans do remain part of Mexico’s ages-old nutritive foothold. That partly explains, I suppose, why fried beans usually share the plate with the typical Mexican snacks, everywhere from market stalls to respectable dining rooms. The other part of the explanation, of course, is that they simply taste good: when their texture is thick and coarse, when the pork lard is full of meaty flavor, and when they’re dressed out with salty queso añejo and tortilla chips.My method of making frijoles refritos calls for less fat than many Mexican recipes. There are two drawbacks to this approach, however: There’s not enough lard to keep them moist and shiny for long, and they can have less flavor unless a really good-tasting fat is used. So, please read the note on keeping fried beans warm, and use the most flavorful fat you can lay your hands on.

    Instructions

   <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
     <li>
      Browning the onion and garlic. If using the onion and/or garlic, heat the fat in a medium-size skillet over medium. Fry the onion until browned, 8 minutes; add the garlic and cook 2 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high. (If not using onion or garlic, heat the fat in the skillet over medium-high.)
     </li>
     <li>
      Mashing and frying the beans. Add one third of the beans and their broth to the skillet. Mash them with the back of a wooden spoon, a blunt-bottomed wooden “potato” masher (which in Mexico is a bean masher) or a potato masher with holes in it. When the beans are coarsely pureed, add the next third, mash, then add and mash the final third. Let the beans simmer, stirring nearly constantly, until they are thick but a little softer than you want to serve them. (They will continue to thicken after you take them off the fire.) The entire mashing and cooking process should take about 8 minutes. Season with salt.
     </li>
     <li>
      Finishing and garnishing the beans. Just before serving, heat the beans over a brisk fire, stirring in a little broth or water if they have thickened more than you’d like. Serve on a warm platter, sprinkled with the crumbled cheese and decorated with the tortilla chips.
