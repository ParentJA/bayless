    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    If the flavors of this picante red-chile sauce are well blended, the heat will have been rounded out with a little softening tomato flavor and balanced with a burst of roasted garlic. I’ve come across carelessly made versions that varied from riveting to impotent to heart-burning. But if you follow the directions laid out here, you’ll turn out a traditionally spirited table sauce that is an unsurpassed condiment for mouthfuls of charcoal-broiled steak.Simple red-chile sauces are in the repertory of cooks all over Mexico (save Yucatán, I believe) and they are commonly made with the very hot chiles de árbol and softened with tomatillo or mellowed with vinegar. This is a version I learned from two infectiously friendly antojito makers in Toluca, and I love it.

   <div class="ingredients">
    <ul>
     <li>
      4 medium (about 1 ounce total) dried chiles guajillos, stemmed, seeded and deveined
     </li>
     <li>
      2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
     </li>
     <li>
      1 ripe, large tomato, roasted, peeled, cored and roughly chopped
     </li>
     <li>

    Instructions

   <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
     <li>
      The chiles and garlic. Tear the guajillo chiles into flat pieces, then toast them on a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, using a metal spatula to press them flat to the hot surface for a few seconds, then flipping and pressing again. You’ll notice a toasted look to each side and perhaps a whiff of smoke when they’re ready, but don’t burn them or they’ll taste bitter.
     </li>
     <li>
      the unpeeled garlic on the griddle and turn frequently until soft and blackened in spots, about 15 minutes. Cool, peel off the skin and cut in quarters.
     </li>
     <li>
      Blending the ingredients. Break the chiles into a dry blender jar, cover and blend on high until pulverized. Add the garlic, roasted tomato, optional chile chipotle and ¼ cup water, then blend until very smooth.
     </li>
     <li>
      Finishing the sauce. Strain the saurce through a medium-mesh sieve into a small dish, then stir in a little more water, if necessary, to make a light, pourable consistency. Season with salt and let stand for ½ hour to let the flavors mingle.
     </li>
