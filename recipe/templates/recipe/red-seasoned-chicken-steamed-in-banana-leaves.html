    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    With the earthy, spicy marinade, the roasted peppers and fresh tomatoes, the fragrant banana-leaf wrapper and the crown of crunchy, pink pickled onions, this dish is one of the glories of Mexican cooking. I like to serve it by itself, with only steaming corn tortillas as an accompaniment. For a first course, creamy Fresh Corn Chowder would be delicious, as would be a dessert of Spicy Poached Guavas or fresh berries.

      Marinating the chicken. Halve the chicken breasts and place in a noncorrosive bowl with the thighs. Mix together the seasoning paste, 4 tablespoons of the bitter orange juice and the salt; if your homemade seasoning paste looks gritty, blend the mixture for a minute or so to smooth it out. Pour it over the chicken, mix thoroughly, cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight. Refrigerate the remaining bitter orange juice for use in Step 3.
     </li>
     <li>
      Other preliminaries. Prepare the banana leaves as described and cut eight 18-inch lengths of kitchen string for tying the packages.
     </li>
     <li>
      t the lard or oil in a medium-size skillet over medium, add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Scoop the onion and all the lard or oil into a small dish, then mix in the chile strips.
     </li>
     <li>
      Preparing the packages. Lay out the banana leaves shiny-side up and brush lightly with oil. Place a breast half and thigh in the center of each one, top with a portion of onion-chile mixture and 2 rounds of tomato. Sprinkle each with ½ tablespoon of the reserved bitter orange juice, a quarter of any fat remaining from the onion-chile mixture, and a quarter of the remaining marinade.
     </li>
     <li>
      d each of the packages: Pick up the two short sides of the leaf and bring them to meet (face-to-face, not overlapping), then fold over twice, to make a tight (French) seam; fold in the top and bottom, overlapping them in the center, then use 2 strings to tie the package snugly in both directions.
     </li>
     <li>
      Steaming the chicken. About 40 minutes before serving, set up a large steamer with an inch of water in the bottom. Place the packages on the steamer rack, cover and steam over medium to medium-low heat for 30 to 35 minutes. Retrieve a package, untie it and check that the thigh is cooked through and tender.
     </li>
     <li>
      Serving. Remove the packages to warm dinner plates. Cut the strings and open up each package, being careful to contain the juices. Fold the edges of the banana leaves underneath for an attractive presentation, top with a little of the pickled red onions and serve.
