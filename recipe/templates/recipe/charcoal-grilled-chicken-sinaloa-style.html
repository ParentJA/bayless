    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    The smoky places are set up at crossroads or scattered around Sinaloan towns, with their bricked-in troughs for embers and their split chickens, searing and charring two feet above the fire. If there’s a place to sit, it’s usually folding chairs and tables; but what more is necessary for a wonderful picnic of pollo a las brasas (literally “chicken over the embers”), Charcoal-Grilled Baby Onions, Salsa Mexicana and steaming corn tortillas?You might want to add Charro Beans, Grill-Roasted Corn or Zucchini with Roasted Peppers, Corn and Cream. Picadillo Turnovers would be a good informal appetizer, and Mexican Chocolate Ice Cream with a drizzle of Kahlúa could be dessert. To drink: Mexican Sangria or beer. This recipe, with its mild, garlicky marinade, is based on one that appeared in Gastrotur magazine.

     <li>
      Splitting the chickens for grilling. Using a large knife or kitchen shears, cut down both sides of the backbone of 1 chicken, through the joints where the legs attach, then on through the ribs; remove the backbone. Open the chicken out flat on your cutting board, skin-side up, and press on the breastbone to loosen it so the chicken will lie flat. For the nicest presentation, make a small incision through the skin toward the bottom of each thigh and press the end of the nearest drumstick through it; this will hold the leg in place as the chicken is grilled. Repeat with the second chicken, then lay them in a noncorrosive bowl.

      Marinating the chickens. Puree all the marinade ingredients in a blender or food processor. Pour the mixture over the chickens and rub them to coat thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours (or, preferably, overnight), turning the chickens several times.
     </li>

      Grilling and serving the chickens. About 1¼ hours before serving, light your charcoal fire, let it burn until the coals are only medium-hot, then position the grill about 8 inches above the coals and lightly oil it. Lay the chickens on the grill, skin-side up, and grill for 35 to 45 minutes, turning every 10 minutes and basting with any leftover marinade. They are ready when tender, and when a fork pricked deep into the thigh brings up clear (not pink) juices. (During the final 10 minutes of cooking, grill the onions, as described—Charcoal-Grilled Baby Onions—if you are using them.) Cut the chickens into quarters, lay them on a warm platter and serve.
