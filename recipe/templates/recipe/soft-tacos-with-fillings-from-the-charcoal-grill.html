      years, would-be sophisticates of the Mexican food scene have looked right over the wood fires and the heaps of smoldering charcoal that seared thin slabs of meat and radiated their heat into pots of beans and pozole and menudo. In Mexico, the gourmands still mostly brush that cooking aside as primitive—good only for a steak or slow-roasted kid, but not for serious cooking. But I was reared in a family that put bread on its table by putting hickory-smoked meats on the tables of others, so I’ve always been more captivated by what a smoky fire can do than by any powers of a blue gas flame or a safe electric burner.

      rcoal-grilled meat (and tacos made from it) has been a specialty of the North for a long time. But the spreading popularity of tacos al carbón has led people to put in taquerías with charcoal grills across much of the country; many even serve the Northern flour tortillas, if they can get them.

      os al carbón is an easy summer supper or picnic: Just prepare a couple of side dishes to fill in, then charcoal-grill some skirt steak according to the recipe that follows (or prepare one of the variations) and bring it to the table for the hungry to make into solid “main course” tacos. If given half a chance, I’d choose to invite 8 or 10 people for a relaxed afternoon cookout, but first I’d make sure my grill was the right size. It should be large enough to hold a 12-inch square of aluminum foil for cooking the green onions, an 8-inch-diameter pot for beans, another pot for warm corn tortillas, and have space left over for grilling the meat. To the side, you need a cutting board and knife, plus an easily accessible spot for all the condiments. Build the bulk of your fire under the open part of the grill, letting a few coals stay below the foil and the two pots. Grill some onions slowly, then heap them up entirely on the foil. Pass small bowls of beans, then grill your prepared meat(s) a little at a time, serving each batch with onions and a stack of hot tortillas.

      paring the tortillas: About 20 minutes before serving, steam-heat the corn tortillas as described. Just before serving, set them to the back of the grill (where they will keep warm for 45 minutes or longer). Griddle-heated tortillas are common with tacos al carbón, but they are generally impractical for home grilling. Flour tortillas are also traditional with this Northern-bred fare: Heat them in packages of 8 to 10, as directed. Keep them warm in a very low oven and bring them out a package at a time.
