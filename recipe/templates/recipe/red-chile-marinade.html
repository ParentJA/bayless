    Description

   <div class="description">
    This marinade brings to life Chile-Marinated Pork and Fish Adobado in Cornhusks. It lasts indefinitely in the refrigerator, since vinegar, chile and salt are three preservatives that for centuries have been put to work in Mexican kitchens. I keep it around to spread on pork chops or ribs that I marinate and bake slowly, and it’s an excellent quick marinade for a flavorful, meaty fish fillet, gently pan-fried or charcoal-grilled.I developed this recipe while living in Oaxaca. My butcher gave me some of her adobo to use as a guide and told me how she made it. Though she called for all guajillos, I’ve used some of the sweeter anchos as well (as many cookbooks suggest).

    Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle or heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until blackened in spots and very soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool, skin and roughly chop.While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly against the hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister, crackle and change color, then flip them over and press them flat to toast the other side.2. Soaking the chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30 minutes. Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and add the garlic.3. Finishing the adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add to the chiles along with the oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 tablespoons water. With a long series of blender pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste: Run the blender for a few seconds until the mixture clogs, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and stir; repeat a dozen times or more until the mixture is smooth. Don’t add water unless absolutely necessary or this marinating paste won’t do its job well. Strain the paste through a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.

      first has the flavor of the red achiote seeds that grow plentifully in the peninsula in pods that resemble the fruit of the horse chestnut. They’re ground with the definitive lot of Yucatecan herbs and spices (oregano, black pepper, cloves, cumin) plus garlic and a little vinegar. The combination is one of the tastiest, most likable and most popular flavorings in Yucatán—whether smeared on chicken, pork or fish for baking in banana leaves or added to tamales and stews. In books published as early as 1832, I’ve come across this recado… so cooks in the area have had a long tradition of cooking with preblended spices. This red one goes by recado rojo (“red recado”) as well as adobo de achiote (“achiote seasoning”).

      second flavoring is the gentlest to nonnative tongues, made entirely of garlic and spices (usually including a good pinch of native allspice and sometimes cinnamon). When you buy preportioned packets, they’re labeled recado de bistec (“steak recado”); but as far as I can tell, the seasoning is most often used in the local escabeche dishes. It is so much easier than the other two pastes that cooks who are really proud of their escabeches make it from scratch.

      black paste, called recado negro (“black recado”), chirmole or chilmole, is the most exotic and indigenous-tasting of the flavorings. It’s made black from carbonized—that is, black-burnt—chiles, then it’s enriched with a little achiote, the spices and garlic. The cooks use it in a ground-pork “stuffing” (but negro) that’s part of the more famous pavo en relleno negro (literally “turkey with black stuffing”). “Eating it is an act of faith,” says R. B. Read in his Gastronomic Tour of Mexico, “since you can’t tell what you’re putting in your mouth, but you’re aided considerably by the fact that, somehow, it’s delicious.”

      s is the triad of flavorings that distinguish most of the traditional Yucatecan dishes. I’ve included recipes for the first two pastes, since you’ll find need for them in several preparations in following chapters.
