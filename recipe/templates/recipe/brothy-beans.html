    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    Olla: the pot, an orange-brown earthenware cooking pot. And those who’ve tasted the beans that come from it know that the olla and contents share an earthy exchange of flavors. Today, it is less common that the ollas do their cooking nestled in live coals; so, sadly, one rarely finds beans that blend a slight smokiness with the clay and elementally bland starch. Instead, the cooking is over a gas burner and, more often than not, the clay has been replaced by enameled metal or plain aluminum.Thousands eat these brothy beans every day in simple market fondas, with a stack of hot tortillas, a little coarse salt and some hot green chiles. And they’re on hand in many Mexican kitchens, to be doled out at a moment’s notice if hunger persists after the meal’s main course. Even a few midday comidas corridas in old-style eateries still offer them that way—after the stew is finished, before the pudding arrives. But because today’s progressive portions are no doubt larger than in earlier, leaner times, the beans come to the table less and less.

    Ingredients
   </h3>
   <div class="ingredients">
    <ul>
     <li>
      2 cups (about 13 ounces total) dry beans: pink, pinto, black or another variety
     </li>
     <li>
      2 tablespoons lard, bacon drippings or fat rendered from chorizo sausage
     </li>
     <li>
      1 small onion, diced
     </li>
     <li>
      1 large sprig epazote for black beans (optional)
     </li>
     <li>
      Salt, about 1 teaspoon
     </li>
    </ul>

      Rinsing and soaking the beans. Measure the beans into a colander, pick out any tiny dirt clods or pebbles, rinse and place in a 4-quart pan. Add 6 cups water, remove any beans that float, and let soak 4 to 8 hours, until you see no dry core when you break one open. Or quick-soak the beans by boiling them for a minute or 2, then letting them stand off the fire for 1 hour. Drain the beans completely.
     </li>

      Cooking the beans. Cover the beans with 6 cups fresh water, add the lard or other fat, onion and optional epazote, and bring slowly to a simmer. Partially cover and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until they are fully tender, 1 to 2 hours. If you see the beans peeking up through the liquid, add hot water to cover them by ½ inch; without enough water, the beans may cook unevenly and tend to stick on the bottom.

      son with salt, remove the epazote, and the beans are ready to serve.
