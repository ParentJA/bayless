    Description

   <div class="description">
    Through the steeply mountainous terrain of Guerrero, from Acapulco up through Taxco, Thursday is green pozole day, a day to close up shop in midafternoon and adjourn to small pozole “restaurants”—many of them only makeshift arrangements of tables and chairs that go public only this one day a week. The big earthernware bowls they serve are thick with hominy and redolent with ground pumpkinseeds and rich herbs—without exception, my favorite of the pozoles. We ate it once, back in the winding streets above Tixtla, with botanas (“drinking snacks”) of tender sliced tongue and the region’s famous little crispy tortilla boats (chalupitas) with sweet-sour pickled chipotles. And since it was Guerrero, there were shots of mescal, some of it made deliciously smooth by adding nanches (chokecherries).The very traditional recipe that follows was taught to me by Abaku Chautla D. in Almolonga, Guerrero. It is a meal in itself: Some light tostadas and Flan are all you need to make it really special.

    Instructions

   <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
     <li>
      The hominy. As directed on, parboil the dried field corn with slaked lime, clean off the hulls, and, if you like, pick off the heads. Place in a large stockpot or soup kettle with 7 quarts of water, bring to a boil, partially cover and simmer over medium-low heat until the corn is nearly tender, 3 to 4 hours. Add water periodically to bring it back to its original level.
     </li>
     <li>
      ned hominy simply needs to be drained and rinsed.
     </li>
     <li>
      The meat. Using dried corn: When the corn is nearly tender, add the meat, bones and chicken. After the liquid returns to a boil, skim off the foam for several minutes. Partially cover and simmer 3 hours, adding water periodically to bring it back to its original level. Then taste the corn: If it is thoroughly soft and the kernels are splayed open, you are ready to proceed; if it is still firm, let it cook another hour or so.
     </li>
     <li>
      ng canned hominy: Measure 7 quarts water into a kettle or stockpot and add the meat, bones and chicken. Bring to a boil, skim off the foam for the first 5 minutes of simmering, partially cover and cook over medium-low heat for 3 hours. Add water periodically to bring it back to its original level.
     </li>
     <li>
      le the meat is cooking, complete Steps 3 and 4.
     </li>
     <li>
      The pumpkinseeds. Heat a large (12-inch) skillet for a few minutes over medium-low. Add the pumpkinseeds in a shallow layer and, when the first one pops, stir them constantly for several minutes, until all have popped and turned a golden color. Remove the seeds to a large bowl.
     </li>
     <li>
      The soup-base puree. Cook fresh tomatillos until tender in salted water to cover, about 10 minutes. Drain either the fresh or canned tomatillos and add to the pumpkinseeds, along with the green chile, onion and herbs. Remove 2 cups of broth from the pot and pour over the mixture. Scoop half the mixture into a blender jar and blend until smooth; if the mixture is too thick to move through the blades, add a little more broth to get it going again. Strain through a medium-mesh sieve, then repeat the pureeing and straining with the rest of the mixture.
     </li>
     <li>
      a large skillet over medium-high heat and measure in the lard or oil. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree really sizzle, add it all at once and stir constantly for about 7 minutes, until it has darkened some and thickened noticeably. Remove from the fire.
     </li>
     <li>
      Finishing the pozole verde. Remove the meat and bones from the pot and set aside to cool. Stir the pumpkinseed mixture into the pot. If you are using canned hominy, add it now. Let simmer for an hour, stirring frequently to ensure that nothing is sticking on the bottom.
     </li>
     <li>
      le the soup is simmering, skin and bone the chicken and pork, removing all the fat; shred the meat into large strands.
     </li>
     <li>
      teen minutes before serving, season the soup with salt (hominy requires considerable salt) and add the shredded meat to the pot. Place the condiments on the table in small serving dishes. Finally, dish up a large bowl of the pozole verde for each guest and pass the condiments for each to add al gusto.
