    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    The chile and vinegar tenderize the meat and give it that incomparable Mexican savor; the spices and herbs make it rich-tasting and attractive.As in jerky-making, slicing the meat for this preparation is easily mastered, and there’s nothing tricky about the marinade. The finished sheets of pork can be enjoyed simply fried like pork steaks and served with Roasted Pepper Rajas on the side, or they can be fried and sliced for tacos.

    <ul>
     <li>
      A 1¼-pound piece of lean, boneless pork loin

     <li>
      1/3 cup Red-Chile Marinade (Adobo,

     <li>
      Trimming the meat. Using a sharp knife (such as a boning, filleting or slicing knife), trim off the cap of fat that covers one side of the pork loin. On the other side of the loin, there may be a strip that runs the length and has a different texture than the solid loin meat: Separate it by running your hand down the membrane that connects it to the loin, then cut it off and reserve for pork fillings and the like. If there is membrane or fat covering any of the surfaces, trim it off. The piece of loin should now be clear, solid meat from one end to the other.
     </li>
     <li>
      Slicing the meat. Slice the meat “accordian” fashion, into a single 1/8-inch-thick strip, as described in Step 1.
     </li>
     <li>
      Coating and marinating the meat. Coat the meat with adobo and restack it: Spread a scant tablespoon of the paste over the center of a small plate, lay the bottom layer of meat over it, spread with a thin cap of adobo, fold over the next layer of meat, spread with adobo, and so on, until the meat has been restacked with a little adobo between all layers. Spread the top and sides with adobo, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or, preferably, overnight.
