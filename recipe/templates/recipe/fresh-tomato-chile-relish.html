    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    All over this temperate country, which year-round offers crimson-orange tomatoes with good flavor, a salsa mexicana made from ripe tomatoes is a traditional condiment put on tables in taquerías and cafeterías, bus stations and homey dining rooms.I’ve never been keen on tomatoes that fall short of that, like the common, mealy store-bought ones. But when the red fruit is full of perfume, salsa mexicana comes across with the balanced strength of sweet tomato, hot green chiles, crunchy onion and aromatic fresh coriander—flavors at the heart of the Mexican kitchen.This definitive, relishy sauce is available in every region of Mexico, with a texture that ranges from a beautiful coarse puree to an unhappy collection of grape-size pieces. The Yucatecan name for the mixture is xnipec (which means, rather picturesquely, “nose of the dog”—see variation recipe); in the rest of Mexico, it can be salsa cruda, salsa fresca, salsa, chile, you name it; and in Texas, you get it when you ask for pico de gallo (literally “rooster’s beak”), which would get you something entirely different in West Central Mexico.

      Chopping the ingredients. Core the tomato, then optionally seed it by cutting across the width and squeezing out the seeds and liquid. Chop it very finely (so that no pieces are larger than 1/16 inch) and scoop into a small bowl. If you want a milder sauce, seed the chiles, then chop very finely and add to the tomatoes. Finely chop the onion and garlic and add to the bowl along with the coriander.

      Seasoning the sauce. Stir in the salt, vinegar (or lime juice) and 1 tablespoon water, then let the flavors mingle for ½ hour or so before serving.
