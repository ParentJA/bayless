      paring Cornhusks or Banana Leaves. For cornhusks: Simmer the husks in water to cover for 10 minutes. Weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and let stand off the fire for a couple of hours until the husks are pliable.

      n you are ready to form the tamales, separate out the largest and most pliable husks—ones that are at least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 or 7 inches long. If you can’t find enough good ones, overlap some of the larger ones to give wide, sturdy, unbroken surfaces to spread the dough on. Pat the chosen leaves dry with a towel.
     </li>
     <li>
      banana leaves: Defrost overnight in the refrigerator if they’re frozen, then unfold and cut off the long, hard side of the leaf (where it was attached to the central vein). Look for holes or rips, then cut the leaf into unbroken, 12-inch segments.
     </li>
     <li>
      up a large steamer with about an inch of water; loosely roll up the banana-leaf squares, place in the steamer, cover and steam for 20 to 30 minutes, until the leaves are soft and very pliable. Or simply pass the banana leaves slowly over a medium gas flame, one at a time, until they change texture (as the oil rises to the surface) and become more pliable; don’t overdo it or they’ll become brittle.

      ting up the steamer for tamales. Steaming less than 20 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in a collapsible vegetable steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. For larger quantities, you need something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in Mexico (and occasionally sold in the United States); mine is a two-part apparatus, the bottom of the top half of which is perforated for steam to pass through. You can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 upturned custard cups in a large kettle.

      n steaming banana leaf—wrapped tamales, you need lots of space. In Mexico, they use the large steamers described above and stack the tamales on top of each other. I prefer to lay the tamales in single layers in stacked Chinese bamboo steamers; they cook more evenly and retain their shape better. Lacking the Mexican or Chinese alternatives, improvise a supported-rack assemblage in a kettle.
     </li>

      is best to line all steamers with extra cornhusks or banana leaves to protect the tamales from direct steam contact and to add more flavor. Make sure that there are small openings for drainage, so condensing steam won’t pool.

      ming Tamales. To form tamales in cornhusks: First tear extra husks into ¼-inch-wide, 7-inch-long strips—one for each tamal. Lay out a large, lightly dried cornhusk with the tapering end toward you. Spread a portion (3 tablespoons or ¼ cup, depending on the recipe) of the dough into about a 4-inch square, leaving at least a 1½-inch border on the side toward you and a ¾-inch border along the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). Spoon the filling (if there is one) down the center of the dough. Pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will cause the dough to surround the filling). If the uncovered borders of the two long sides you’re holding are narrow, then tuck one side under the other; if wide, then roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. If the husk is small, wrap the tamal in a second husk. Finally, fold up the empty 1½-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly closed “bottom,” leaving the top open), then secure it in place by loosely tying one of the strips of husk around the tamal. As they’re made, stand the tamales on the folded bottom in the prepared steamer. Don’t tie the tamales too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer; they need room to expand.
     </li>
     <li>
      form tamales in banana leaves: First cut a 12-inch length of string for each tamal. Then lay out one of the prepared squares of banana leaf, shiny-side up, and spread one portion (usually ½ cup) dough into an 8x4-inch rectangle over it, as shown in the illustration. Spoon or lay the filling over the left side of the rectangle of dough, then fold in the right third of the leaf so that the dough encloses the filling. Fold in the uncovered third of the leaf, then fold in the top and bottom. Loosely tie the tamales with string and set them in the steamer.
     </li>

      aming Tamales. When all tamales are in the steamer, cover them with a layer of leftover husks or banana leaves; if your husk-wrapped tamales don’t take up the entire steamer, fill in the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum foil (to keep the tamales from falling down). Set the lid in place and steam over a constant medium heat for about 1 hour for tamales made from fresh masa, 1¼ to 1½ hours for those made from the substitute. Watch carefully that all the water doesn’t boil away and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling water into the pot when more is necessary.
     </li>
     <li>
      ales are done when the husk or leaf peels away easily; tamales made from the substitute masa may seem a little sticky when they are done. Let tamales stand in the steamer off the fire for a few minutes, to firm up.
