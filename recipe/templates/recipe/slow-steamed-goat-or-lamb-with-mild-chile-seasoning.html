    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    Birria is the West-Central cousin of the Central barbacoa—the special-occasion, pit-cooked lamb in maguey “leaves.” And for the most flavorful version of birria, lamb or goat is spread with chile paste and baked tightly covered to roast and steam in its juices. Birria vendors have come up with special pots and ovens to replicate the earth pits their forefathers made, and many (especially in Guadalajara) have done away with the maguey wrappers—relying exclusively on the chiles for added flavor.This typical recipe, from one of the Guadalajara birria vendors, uses the slow-cooking juices for a delectable, brothy sauce flavored with oregano and tomato. Where the vendor used a special oven, I’ve called for a Dutch oven sealed with masa, as recommended in Velázquez de León’s Viajando por las cocinas de las provincias de la República Mexicana. Like pot roast, birria needs to be featured at a special, informal dinner: serve it with hot tortillas, preceded by Chunky Guacamole; ice cream with warm Goat-Milk Caramel would be a nice dessert. To drink: beer, perhaps a red wine like Zinfandel, or Tamarind Cooler.

    Instructions
   </h3>
   <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
     <li>
      The meat. Trim most of the fat from the meat (it is strong-tasting); if it is a goat hindquarter, cut into 2 pieces with a cleaver, severing it through the joint at the top of the leg. Place in a large noncorrosive dish.
     </li>
     <li>
      The chile marinade. Heat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium. Tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast them a few at a time, pressing them against the hot surface with a metal spatula until they crackle and blister, then flipping them over and pressing them again. Cover with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged and soak 30 minutes. Roast the garlic on the hot griddle or skillet, turning frequently, until soft inside and blackened outside, about 15 minutes. Cool and peel.
     </li>
     <li>
      in the chiles and place in a blender jar with the garlic and vinegar. Pulverize the cumin and peppercorns in a mortar or spice grinder, and add to the blender along with the salt and ¾ cup water. Blend until smooth, then strain through a medium-mesh sieve. Remove ½ cup, stir in the sugar, cover and set aside for the final glazing. Spread the rest of the chile paste over the meat, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight.
     </li>
     <li>
      Slow-steaming. Preheat the oven to 325°. Set a roasting rack into a deep, wide kettle or stockpot; if it doesn’t sit at least 1 inch above the bottom of the pot, prop it up on custard cups, tin cans or the like. Measure in 3 cups of water, then lay the marinated meat on the rack and spread any remaining marinade over it.
     </li>
     <li>
      water to the masa (or masa harina mixture) to make a soft dough. Roll tennis ball—size pieces between your palms to make ¾-inch ropes, then press them gently all around the top edge of your pot. Set the lid in place and press it into the masa to seal. Bake for 3 hours.
     </li>
     <li>
      Finishing the broth. Break the seal by tapping the hardened masa with the back of a cleaver or mallet, and take off the lid; then carefully remove the tender meat. Take out the rack, spoon the fat off the broth, then measure it. You need at least 1 quart—if necessary, add water to bring it to that level. Pour the broth into a small saucepan.
     </li>
     <li>
      ee the tomato in a blender or food processor, add it to the broth along with the oregano, cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes. Season with salt.
     </li>
     <li>
      Glazing and serving the birria. Shortly before serving, remove the bones, large pieces of gristle and excess fat from the meat, keeping the pieces of meat as large as possible. Set the meat on a baking sheet, brush lightly with the reserved chile-paste glaze, then bake for 10 minutes to set the glaze.
     </li>
     <li>
      her present the meat on a large platter and pass the warm broth separately, or slice the meat across the grain and serve it in deep plates, awash in the broth. Mix the onion and fresh coriander, and pass it with the lime at the table.
