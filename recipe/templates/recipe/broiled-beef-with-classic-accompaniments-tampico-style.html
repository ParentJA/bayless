    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    There could scarcely be a restaurant dish more common, more distinctly Mexican, than this “combination” plate: a tender strip of quick-seared beef, a bowl of tasty beans, guacamole, a saucy enchilada and perhaps some lightly browned rajas of chile and onion.The plate has nothing really to do with the port town of Tampico, but rather, was named by the tampiqueño José Luis Loredo. When the famous waiter moved from oil-rich Tampico to Mexico City in 1939 to open the Tampico Club, his carne asada a la tampiqueña became a signature dish. Though variations abound, I’ve presented the traditional version offered at such Loredo restaurants as Colonial Loredo and Caballo Bayo; I’ve left off the grilled square of cheese, simply because the necessary nonmelting, panela-style cheese is uncommon here. Flour or corn tortillas and a sauce like Red-Chile Sauce, Chile Chipotle Sauce, or Salsa Mexicana are all you need to make this dish a meal. Beer, Jamaica “Flower” Cooler or Mexican Sangria would be my drink choices; and I’d want a Sweet Fresh-Cheese Pie for dessert.

    Instructions

   <div class="instructions">
    <ol>
     <li>
      Seasoning the meat. Lay the steaks in a noncorrosive dish and sprinkle both sides with the lime juice. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 4 hours.
     </li>
     <li>
      Other prepare-ahead preliminaries. Scrape the cooked beans into one small saucepan and the tomatillo sauce into another; cover them and set aside. Scoop the rajas into a small, oven-proof dish, cover with foil and set aside.
     </li>
     <li>
      Last-minute preliminaries. About an hour before serving, put together the guacamole. Lay the romaine leaves on a plate and mound a portion of guacamole on each one; decorate with radish roses or slices. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
     </li>
     <li>
      the tortillas are moist, lay them in a single layer to dry until leathery. Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high. When hot enough to make the edge of a tortilla really sizzle, quick-fry the tortillas one at a time, about 3 seconds per side, to soften them. Drain well on paper towels, stack them up, wrap in foil, place in the oven and turn it on to 200°. Set the skillet aside to use for frying the meat.
     </li>
     <li>
      out the cheese and onion. Place the rajas and 4 large heatproof dinner plates in the oven. Set the beans and the tomatillo sauce over low heat to reheat.
     </li>
     <li>
      Frying the meat. Dry the steaks on paper towels, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat the skillet from Step 3 over medium-high; if there isn’t enough oil left to lightly coat the bottom, add a little more. When the pan is quite hot, lay in the steaks. Fry rare or medium-rare, 1½ to 2 minutes per side; don’t overcook. Remove to a wire rack set over a plate and keep warm in the oven. (As the meat “rests,” it will reabsorb juices that would otherwise leak out when cut.)
     </li>
     <li>
      Assembling the dish. Lay out the plates and assemble 2 enchiladas on each one: Remove a tortilla from the foil, lay it on the side of one plate, ladle a little sauce in the center, fold in half, then ladle sauce over the top; repeat with a second tortilla, letting it overlap the first one a little, then sprinkle them with the cheese and onion. Lay a steak on each plate, top with a portion of the rajas, then slide a “romaine boat” of guacamole in beside it. Serve immediately with bowls of steaming beans set to the side of each plate.
