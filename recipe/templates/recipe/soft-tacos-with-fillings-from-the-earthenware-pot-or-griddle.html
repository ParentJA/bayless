   <div class="description">
    In Spanish bars, they put out dishes of warm and cool mixtures made with seafood, vegetables and the like: tapas, to spoon onto your plate and enjoy with a drink. Tacos de cazuela are a sort of Mexican equivalent, though they fill in more as a tortilla-wrapped light meal than as a preprandial snack.Just about any of the thick-sauced meat dishes (“stews,” as we might call them) for which the different regions are known can show up in stands that sell tacos de cazuela, so these tacos often have quite interesting and varied fillings. And if the vendor keeps them warm in thick earthenware vessels (cazuelas), the scene can be as beautiful as the tacos are tasty. Unfortunately, earthenware is fast being replaced by enamelware and even steam tables in towns like Hermosillo, Sonora and Veracruz.I’ve seen big griddles for tacos de la plancha on the streets of most Mexican cities, save those in Yucatán. One beautiful stand has for years been set up on the wharf in Veracruz: Spread on the counter that’s hooked to the front of the butane-fired griddle is a thick carpet of fresh flat-leaf parsley; on top sits a rock mortar full of guacamole followed by help-yourself bowls of chile de árbol sauce, salsa mexicana, peeled cucumbers, lime wedges and radishes. It’s a fragrant sight and the little steak-and-onion, tripe or chorizo tacos are delicious.An equally delicious and varied assortment of cazuela and plancha soft taco fillings begins after the following general directions.

      paring the Tortillas: Steam-heat corn tortillas as described; keep them warm in the steamer in a very low oven, and bring them out as needed. Flour tortillas should be heated as directed; keep them in a very low oven and bring them out a few at a time. It is customary that vendors of tacos de la plancha will heat very fresh small corn tortillas directly on the lightly greased griddle. In addition to warming them, the little bit of grease makes them more pliable and less given to falling apart.

      to Serve Soft Tacos: For a small group, simply set out hot tortillas and pass the fillings in warm bowls. Complete the meal with Frijoles Refritos and a salad. For a large, informal, come-and-go party, set out a number of fillings on warming trays or in small chafing dishes (always include 1 or 2 cold or room-temperature ones; also Seviche or Shredded Beef Salad with Avocado fit here nicely). Have a good supply of different sauces like Guacamole with Tomatillos, Salsa Mexicana and Salsa Picante set nearby; Roasted Pepper Rajas go well with the griddle-cooked fillings. Frequently replenish baskets of flour and corn tortillas. Prepare griddle-cooked or other last-minute fillings in small batches throughout the party. Set out some forks for those who decide to eat the fillings without tortillas. Charro Beans ladled into cups and Mixed Vegetable Salad or Jícama Salad always seem welcome. Sweet Fresh-Cheese Pie and a bowl of fruit would make a sweet, simple ending to the party.
