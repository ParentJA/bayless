    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    I scooted onto a bar stool in a spiffy-looking marketplace fonda in Tampico. To tell the truth, I’d never seen one of these places with an espresso machine and ceiling fans before. It was Saturday morning and the crowd was spooning down bowls of weekends-only mondongo (the Gulf Coast name for this popular tripe soup), so I followed the lead. And before I left town, I’d returned for several more bowls of their tender tripe in well-flavored broth, as well as some chats with the well-fed owner, whose recipe follows here.Though most people associate menudo with Northern states (where it is frequently made without the red chile and with an addition of hominy), versions of this hearty soup show up everywhere. It’s most commonly eaten in the morning (the high vitamin B content, I’ve read, is good for hangovers); if you’re adventurous, serve it for brunch with Quick-Simmered Tortilla Casserole (Chilaquiles) and fresh papaya; or make a supper of it, with Chunky Guacamole and hot corn tortillas.

     <li>
      The tripe. Wash the tripe thoroughly in several changes of warm water. Place it in a large bowl, sprinkle with the 1 tablespoon salt and the lime juice; vigorously work the salt and lime into the tripe with a scrubbing motion. Let stand 30 minutes, then wash the tripe again in several changes of warm water.
     </li>
     <li>
      ce the tripe into small pieces about 2 inches long and ½ inch wide. Place in a large kettle or stockpot, cover with several quarts of cold water, bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes. Pour into a colander set in the sink, let drain a minute, then return to the pan.

     <li>
      Simmering the tripe. Add the cow’s or pig’s foot, the marrow bones and 3 quarts water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and skim off the foam that rises during the first few minutes of cooking. Add half the garlic to the pot along with the onion and oregano; partially cover and simmer until the tripe is very tender, 2 to 3 hours.

     <li>
      The chile flavoring and final preparations. When the tripe is nearly tender, heat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium. Tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast them a few at a time by laying them on the hot surface, pressing them flat with a metal spatula for several seconds, until they blister and color a little, then flipping them over and pressing down for a few seconds more. Place them in a small bowl, cover with boiling water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and soak 30 minutes.

     <li>
      ove the cow’s or pig’s foot and all the marrow bones from the broth, then skim off any fat floating on top. If you wish, let the foot cool a little, then cut out and discard all the bone and cartilage, chop what remains into small pieces and return it to the pot.
     </li>
     <li>
      in the chiles and place them in a blender jar with the remaining garlic and the ground cumin. Add 1/3 cup of the menudo broth, blend until smooth, then strain through a medium-mesh sieve into the pot. Season with salt, partially cover and simmer 30 minutes.
