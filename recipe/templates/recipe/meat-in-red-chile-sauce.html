    Description

   <div class="description">
    When it’s made on Mexican soil and the name chile con carne is flipped around, I doubt the venerable Mexican dictionary writers describe the dish as “detestable” in the least. No, the Northern Mexican carne con chile colorado is a good, simple dish—mild, dried chiles mellowed with garlic and sparked with cumin—and it’s so routinely served up on Northern plates and in Northern tacos and burritos that the rest of Mexico wonders if the cooks there know anything else. I once asked a Yucatecan woman, working in a Los Angeles tortilla factory with a bunch of Northern Mexicans, about the filling in the factory’s tamales. She whispered, “With these folks, you can have carne con chile or chile con carne. Take your pick.”I’ve always smiled at the Texan claim of inventing “chili.” I won’t argue that it’s their regional specialty, but the practice of cooking dried chiles with meat was in full gear when the Spaniards met the first American Indians. Of course, the Northern Mexican versions may seem simplistic to the Texans, who use chile anchos, occasionally tomatoes or beans, and almost always a gaggle of spices and a good draw of beer.This recipe is one I learned from a restaurant cook in Chihuahua, and it can be featured as an informal main course, accompanied by flour tortillas and Frijoles Refritos or a salad. To drink, beer or Jamaica “Flower” Cooler; and for dessert, Custard Ice Cream.

    Instructions

   <div class="instructions">

     <li>
      The chiles. Heat a griddle or heavy skillet over medium and tear the chiles into flat pieces. Toast them on the hot surface a few at a time, pressing them down firmly with a metal spatula for a few seconds, until they crackle and change color, then flipping them over and pressing down for a few seconds more. Cover the chiles with boiling water, weight down with a plate to keep them submerged, soak 30 minutes, then drain and reserve 1 cup of the soaking liquid.
     </li>
     <li>
      The sauce base. Transfer the chiles and reserved liquid to a blender jar. Add the garlic, onion and oregano. Pulverize the cumin seeds in a mortar or spice grinder, and add to the chile mixture. Blend until smooth, then strain through a medium-mesh sieve.
     </li>
     <li>
      Frying the meat. Heat the lard or oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Dry the pork on paper towels, then lay it in the hot skillet in an uncrowded single layer. Fry until the meat is nicely browned, about 10 minutes, turning it and scraping the pan frequently.
     </li>
     <li>
      Simmering. Add the chile puree to the pan. Continue to fry for 4 or 5 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom frequently, until the puree is very thick and noticeably darker.
     </li>
     <li>
      ape the mixture into a medium-size saucepan, stir in the salt and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, partially cover and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the meat is very tender; if the sauce thickens beyond the consistency of heavy cream, add a little more water. Taste for salt, and the simple stew is ready to serve.
