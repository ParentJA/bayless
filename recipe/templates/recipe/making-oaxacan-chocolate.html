    The common walled dwellings that hug the walkways and streets of Mexican towns create a peculiarly strong sense of public versus unapproachable private…in a country that is so renowned for open festivity. I felt it acutely in Juchitán, Oaxaca, where day after day I heard inexplicable fire-fueled pops and cracks from behind the high wall across the alley from where I was staying.Only after several careful and courteous inquiries was I hesitantly invited into the private patio of the chocolatera. Her cacao beans crackled as they roasted, her charcoal-heated metate coarsely ground the greasy beans back and forth with the cinnamon, almonds and sugar, and her hands patted the paste into fat cigar shapes. The result was then mixed up with water in a green-glazed Oaxacan chocolate mug and whipped frothy with a wooden molinillo. The rich flavor of the fresh, strong chocolate needed nothing more than that water to bring it to life.For most of us nowadays, chocolate is thoroughly refined; it’s spoken of and handled as other precious commodities. We moved long ago beyond the traditional, uncomplicated drink, beyond its original role as liquid sustenance, to all sorts of overcomplicated concoctions and prestigious labels. Until now. When we hear talk once again of the “discovery” of the “wonderful Mexican chocolate,” with its satisfying savor.

      If any man has drunk a little too deeply from the cup of physical pleasure; if he has spent too much time at his desk that should have been spent asleep; if his fine spirits have temporarily become dulled;…we say, let him be given a good pint of amber-flavored chocolate…and marvels will be performed.
