    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    Skirt steak, in my opinion, is one of the most delicious, beefiest-tasting cuts of meat, if it’s a good-quality outside piece and well trimmed. Charcoal-grilled, daubed with Fresh Green Tomatillo Sauce or Chunky Guacamole then wrapped with Roasted Pepper Rajas in a flour tortilla—it is nearly the same as the Texan fajitas that have become very popular in many parts of the United States. Meat for fajitas is frequently marinated, as described.Though arrachera (“skirt steak”) is commonly used only in northeastern Mexico (especially around Monterrey), cooking thin sheets of beef over charcoal is popular throughout the North and everywhere Northerners have set up taquerías. In Hermosillo, Sonora, in fact, street, vendors of tacos de bistec have elaborate chimney-covered charcoal grills built into pushcarts with customized condiment jars to hold salsa roja, salsa mexicana, cucumbers, red onions and radishes. Nearly everywhere, tacos of charcoal-grilled meat are accompanied by lime wedges to squeeze over them.

     <li>
      Preliminaries. Trim the meat of most fat and all the silvery tissue, then cover and refrigerate until grilling time. About 30 minutes before serving, light your charcoal fire and let it burn until the coals are very hot.

      Grilling the arrachera. About 10 minutes before serving, squeeze a little lime over the meat, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over the hot coals for 2 or 3 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the meat and heat of the fire; the meat is best grilled to medium-rare.
     </li>
     <li>
      Cutting and serving the arrachera. Set the steak to the back of the grill (where it isn’t hot enough to continue cooking), and let stand several minutes to reabsorb the juices. Then cut it across the grain into ¼-inch slices; or, alternatively, chop it into ½-inch pieces. Scoop into a small warm bowl and serve right away.
