    Description
   </h3>
   <div class="description">
    I’ve heard it said that North America’s favorite flavor is crisp, so perhaps it’s no wonder that we’ve perfected the crisp chip snack. Yes, it’s our tortilla factories that have learned to make up drier, thinner tortillas (often made of rather coarse-ground masa), especially for frying to a crisp light snap that almost melts in your mouth.Mexicans, on the whole, don’t seem to be as enthralled with the concept of crisp. So they fry sturdier, meatier tortillas, cut up for chips (tostaditas) or left whole for tostadas.For the exigencies of the North American audience, I’ve tackled fried chips and tostadas in considerable detail, ensuring that what you turn out will be crisp and light.

     <li>
      Drying the tortillas. For chips, cut the tortillas into 4 to 6 wedges; for tostadas, leave them whole. Spread into a single layer, cover lightly with a dry towel to keep them from curling, and let dry until very leathery.
     </li>
     <li>
      Frying. Heat the oil to 380°. For tostadas, lay the tortillas in the oil one at a time, flip them after about 30 seconds, then fry them until they are lightly browned and completely crisp, about 30 seconds longer. For chips, distribute a few wedges of tortilla over the oil and stir them nearly constantly to keep them separate, for 45 seconds to 1 minute, until lightly browned and completely crisp. Tostadas/chips are not done until nearly all bubbling has stopped.
     </li>
     <li>
      ove from the oil, shaking off the excess, and drain on paper towels. While the chips are warm, sprinkle with salt, if you like.
